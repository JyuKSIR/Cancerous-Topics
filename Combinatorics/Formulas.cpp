# Combinations (nCr)
# Number of ways to choose r items from n items without considering order
nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

# Special Cases:
nC2 = n! / (2! * (n-2)!) = n*(n-1)/2
nC3 = n! / (3! * (n-3)!) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6
nC4 = n! / (4! * (n-4)!) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)/24

# Permutations (nPr)
# Number of ways to choose r items from n items with order considered
nPr = n! / (n-r)!

# Special Cases:
nP2 = n! / (n-2)! = n*(n-1)
nP3 = n! / (n-3)! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)
nP4 = n! / (n-4)! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)

# combinations
5C3 = 10 (order doesn’t matter)
# permutation
5P3 = 60 (order matters)

# Subarray
* In an n sized array there will be n * (n + 1) / 2 number subarrays.
# Bitwise
* if there is a number like x and if you do (x & -x) that gives you the largest number which is a power of two and that number can divide x
